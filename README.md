### Hi, I'm Prajwal ðŸ‘‹
As a Software Developer, I'm constantly immersed in the world of coding, problem-solving, and building innovative solutions. 
While I may not have any formal teaching roles, I'm always eager to share my knowledge and insights with fellow developers.

Currently, my focus lies in crafting robust backend systems with AWS.

Beyond work, I have a passion for exploration. I'm drawn to remote corners of this world where the landscapes are untouched.

I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring exciting opportunities.
If weâ€™ve never met before, the best way to reach me is via email. I check my inbox frequently.
